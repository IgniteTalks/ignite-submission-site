## About this page

This submission site is designed to elicit presentation proposals from Ignite presenters.

#### Why not just use a Google form?

As your Ignite gets more popular, you may find that you get more submissions from people who've never attended your event. They may be semi-professional speakers who submit proposals to speak _everywhere_.

This can lead to people trying to sell from the stage (which the audience hates) and presenters who have no idea about the 20-slide x 15-second rule of Ignite.

This submission site helps by forcing presenters to slow down, and read a bit of information about Ignite before they submit their proposal.

#### Won't we lose presenters if we make it too hard?

If presenters can't be bothered to click through 4 short pages, they probably don't have the stamina and dedication to prepare and deliver a good Ignite talk, right?
